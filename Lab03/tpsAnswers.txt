TPS 1
1. The 3 pools for memory are static - global variables, stack - local variables, and heap - dynamically allocated variables.

2a. Three variables are declared; num, *ptr, and **header.

2b. Two of them are pointers (ptr and header). Each points to a int data.

2c. These variables are stored in the stack.

2d. The pointer ptr will point to the heap pool memory.

3. 

TPS 2

1. The program creates a node that stores two values (int and float) with pointer to the next node.

3. From the addresses printed structures are stored in the heap while the head pointer is in the stack. The relationship is that the head pointer
from the stack points to the adress allocated in the heap for its members.

Assignment 1
1a. We must pass the size of the array so the function is aware of so it sorts the entirety of the array not more or less than its size.

1b. The original is not being changed because we copy the original, sort and return the copy.

1c. We need s_array because main wants to print the original array and then the bubblesorted array.
