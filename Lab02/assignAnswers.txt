Assignment 1:

1. Line 18 causes the segmentation fault.

2. When using scanf, we need to place an '&' infront of the variable to store it in its address.

3. The bug is that sum is not being updated outside of the method, read_values. So when we go to print it, it is still 0.

4. To fix this, we just need to make the parameter of read_values to be the adress of sum rather than just the variable.

Assignment 2:

1. The output is expected. "Hi!hi!"

2. The output is not as expected. The bug is that the string are still have the previous input saved.

3. The output is not expected. This happens because "Hello! How are you?" is greater than the memory allocated in the str1[10] so the compiler hands it extra memory. Then
When we do str2 it begins it overlaps the memory of str1 with str2.
